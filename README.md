## Problem Description ##

We are using unsupervised learning to allow Chess-AI to continually update the parameters of the network. Chess-AI will use gradient descent to minimize the difference between the predicted and actual outcome of the game after each playthrough. Then, Chess-AI will use backpropagation to update the parameters to improve performance after each playthrough.
